<h1>Endangered Species Pixel Art automatically Generated with Python<h1>

After being inspired by a WWF campaign with art by Yoshiyuki Mikami, I decided to recreate the art style with Python. The images have been posted here: https://imgur.com/gallery/NVNsyel. With over 130k views! Great to spread awareness on a scary topic.
